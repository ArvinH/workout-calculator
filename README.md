# Workout Calculator

![demo](./workout-calculator.png)

A webapp can calcuate your BMR, TDEE and how many carb, protein or fat you should have in each meal each day.

Another reason I build this project is for practicing React/Redux/Typescript/Webpack.

[Note]: This project separated from another project called `fantasy-workout` (WIP), so it contains some file that is not necessary, such as `server.js`, please just ignore it.

To-Do
